# Python Project Info

When working on this project (yapeco):

- Make sure all additions have backwards compatibility with Python ~3.9. No match/case, walrus, etc.
- Also ensure backwards compatibility, especially for typing. E.g. we want to make sure we support:
  - both `list[]` and `List[]` annotations
  - both `Optional[x]` and `x | None`

This is a uv project. Use `uv run <xyz>` to run any venv-scoped command. Use `just test` (aliased to pytest) to run tests. Tests are required after any change.
